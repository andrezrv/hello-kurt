## Hello Kurt

![alt text](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/hello-kurt/assets/banner-772x250.png "Hello Kurt")

Just as [Hello Dolly](http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/), this is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the angst and disconformity that eventually lead to the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation wanting to make a change and mark a difference. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from Smells Like Teen Spirit in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

This is a total rip off from Matt Mullenweg's [Hello Dolly plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/), so all credits should go to him.

## Installation

1. Run `git clone git@github.com:andrezrv/hello-kurt.git` into your plugins folder. You can also download the plugin in zip format either from [Github](https://github.com/andrezrv/hello-kurt/archive/master.zip) and the [WordPress Plugin Repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-kurt/), then open the file and upload the `hello-kurt` folder to your `plugins` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the **"Plugins"** menu.
